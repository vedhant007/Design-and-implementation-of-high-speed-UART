# Design-and-implementation-of-high-speed-UART
In this repository, I will add RTL design and testbench of high-speed UART, which is a serial communication protocol. 
This repository has 2 folders :
1) sources: It contains design verilog code.
2) sim: It contains test bench verilog code.

RTL Schematic :
